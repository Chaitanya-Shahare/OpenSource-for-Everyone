# Finding Users for Your Project
Help your open source project grow by getting it in the hands of happy users.

## Spreading the word
Thereâ€™s no rule that says you have to promote an open source project when you launch. There are many fulfilling reasons to work in open source that have nothing to do with popularity. Instead of hoping others will find and use your open source project, you have to spread the word about your hard work!
