# Developer Workflow
- You're going to practice a typical best practice developer workflow.
#

1. First, you'll fork someone else's code. This means creating your own copy of it.

2. Then you'll create a branch. The branch is a parallel version of your copy, where you'll test your own changes. 

3. You stage your changes as you go. When you're happy with them, you'll commit them. 

4. If you want to add your code to someone else's project, you'll open a pull request. 

5. If they approve it, they'll merge your branch into their master branch. 

- **Key Term:**
  - Fork: your own copy of someone else's repository. 
  - branch: a parallel version of the master copy of a repo. Making a branch allows you to edit code without accidentally breaking a working version.
  - stage: add to a cohesive group/bundle of revisions
  - commit: a group of revisions you want to officially add to your branch
  - merge:  to officially add the changes from your branch into the master branch (or another branch) 

**Great! That's it. That's how you work with Git. Let's try it using GitHub!**

## Network Activity Workflow
- As you can see, there are so many way to use GitHub! Today we're going to use a very common developer workflow.
