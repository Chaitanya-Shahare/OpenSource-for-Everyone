**So let us now, discuss about what is OpenSource??**

A software's original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified according to the requirement of the user.

### Programmers have:
More control over that kind of software & can examine the code to make sure it's not doing anything you don't want it to do, and fix bugs

### What about others?
You can make your projects, blogs, etc.. open source and let others contribute or view your work &many more advantages...

### other advantage includes:

A large community of like minded inspiring people
You get essential support and help
get to collaborate with for your project, work, etc... & many more..... ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©

### So what are you waiting for?? let's get started with one of the well known OpenSource Platforms :
